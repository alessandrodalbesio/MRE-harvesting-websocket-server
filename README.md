# Websocket Server

## Getting started
This is the websocket implementation needed for implementing a dual-way real time communication between the devices. <br><br>
The main functionalities that this server implements are:
- Real time synchronization between all the devices
- Real time synchronization between the optitrack server and the headset

## Installation
To use the code into this repository you just need to clode the code and set the parameters in the file <code>settings.py</code>. <br>
Without settings these parameters you won't be able to start the code! <br>
A brief description of the parameters can be found in the file itself.

## Requirements
This code has been tested with python 3.11 <br>
All the needed modules can be installed from the <code>requirements.txt</code> with the following code:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you wish to use a virtual environment just remember to activate it before running this command!
